    "# Generating music with GTZAN and Keras\n",
    "Let's generate some music! A lot of techniques I've seen around use symbolic methods (generate tabs / midi), but I think giving the model full control over the waveform is a lot more challenging and potentially a lot more fun / cooler. The model architecture I'll be using is very inspired by [this awesome example in the keras docs](https://keras.io/examples/generative/ddim/), which I highly recommend taking a look at if you want to learn more about diffusion models\n",

    "# Explanation of technique\n",
    "Skip this part if you don't like reading 😆. The overall idea here is to generate music directly from spectrograms (or some kind of 2d representation of the audio data) and then convert the spectrogram back to audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature representation\n",
    "I consider this to be the crux of this whole technique. Because image generation with CNNs is very popular and has been super successful recently (especially with the explosive progress made recently with diffusion models). The way I use the audio data is by using a [Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/signal/mdct). Using this particular transform is useful because you can exactly reconstruct your audio waveform from the MDCT spectrogram by applying the inverse MDCT transform. It's also useful because, unlike the fourier transform, all of the values that come from the MDCT transform are real valued. That way, you don't have to fool around with trying to reconstruct the phase of your new signal. This is what allows us to take advantage of 2d convolutional neural networks in order to create a 2d spectrogram and convert it directly to audio.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "I chose U-net, mostly because it seems to be the standard choice for training Diffusion models. I add attention in the bottom upsampling layer. Would be cool to try adding attention to more parts of this model and see how it affects the generated examples. I've intended to, but tend to OOM the GPU when I do. Happy to hear suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training & Sampling\n",
    "In my own personal experiments, I've tried a few different generative models for this task. This includes several types of GAN and VAE models. It seems like diffusion works (by far) much better. I (once again) borrow [this implementation of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models](https://keras.io/examples/generative/ddim/) (seriously, take a read if you're interested. I find it to be very practical and digestable). I pretty arbitrarily choose 1000 diffusion steps for sampling. Maybe more is better? Maybe less? Worth playing with more"
